## Overview

This project involves building a content-based movie recommendation system using Python. The system suggests movies similar to a user-selected movie based on features such as genre, cast, crew, and keywords. It leverages machine learning techniques to calculate similarity scores between movies and provide personalized recommendations.

* Key tools and libraries used include:

* Pandas for data handling and preprocessing

* Scikit-learn for computing similarity measures

* Pickle for model persistence

* Requests for retrieving movie posters from the TMDB API

* Streamlit for developing an interactive and user-friendly web interface

By integrating the TMDB API, the system enhances user experience by displaying visually rich movie posters alongside recommendations. The final web app allows users to conveniently select a movie and instantly view a list of similar movies, making the discovery of new content seamless and engaging.
